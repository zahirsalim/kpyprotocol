# kpyprotocol
The idea of this project is to provide a Python Kurento API Client implementation. 
Currently the project has a base implementation based on understanding obtained from Kurento Documentation.
Libraries used are websockets, jsonrpclients, asyncio
Project is going to support only Python 3. Currently written using Python 3.5 since the testing is done on Ubuntu 16.04 which has a kurento media server repository enabling easy installation. Pythonic support for asynchronous programming is available from 3.5
Recommended to install with virtualenv. Using virtualenvwrapper makes easier
Assuming virtualenv is setup, dependencies can be installed using pip install -r requirements.txt

Looking for contributors to develop, review, test and document all aspects including design
